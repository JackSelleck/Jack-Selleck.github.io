									<h1>Coding C# in unity<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I programmed the unity rhythm game on my own in the span of four weeks<br />
									The code i am most proud of is for the audio analysis and delay<br />
									<a href="https://jackselleck.itch.io/krungus" target= "_blank" a style="font-size: 20px; color: rgb(80, 156, 175);">Link to download unity rhythm game</a> 
								</header>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rhythm Game Unity.png" alt="" /></div>

								<h3>Features</h3>
								      <li> 3D enemy pathfinding and logic
								      <li>  First person melee combat with parrying, long attacks and slashes, and Undertale inspired bullet hell scenes
									  <li>	Tested to run at a smooth 60fps with VSync on lower mid end devices (tested on radeon pro 560, intel i5 7th gen)
									  </li>
									  <p></p>


							    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
								<h4>Boss fight</h4>
								<p> A key part of this boss fight was switching to Undertale esque bullet hell scenes, I combined this with the classic boss fight
									mechanics which appear in mario games, where you  hit a boss out of its stun phase three times to defeat it; 
									here is a consise explanation on how it worked:
                                 
								<li> If the player collides with the boss attack, the ScenesToLoad int is increased by 1
								<li> Further collisions are deemed invalid for a time to stop this int accidentally being increased by more than 1 per hit
							    <li> This int is used to determine which bullet hell fight is loaded, for instance if int = 2 then scene 2 is loaded
							    <li> This results in the player being transported into three scenes in total througout the boss fight, 3rd being the final
							    <li> I detect when the new scene ends and transport the player and boss back to the original scene 
								<li> Now that the bullet hell scene has been completed, the boss is put into a stun phase, allowing it to be attacked
								<li> Three attacks remove it from its stun phase, then once the boss is hit out of its stun phase three times, it is killed

									<h3>What i would have done differently based on my observations of playtesters<br /></h3>
                                        My playtesters did not know to use the block move which made them struggle much more than necessary, to aid this i would have added an immersive tutorial, such as a tip when the game starts,
										showing the player how important the block move is.
                                        <p></p>
										<h3>Other things i would have done differently<br /></h3>
										I believe that since i was spending all of my time developing krungus, (10âˆ¼ hours a day for 2 weeks) that it was harder for me to recognise any flaws with the game since i had become used to them.
										As coming back to the game today, i recognise flaws which i was blind to during development. This experience made me understand the importance of playtesters for commercial games.
										<br>The assets i used are somewhat unoptimised, however this experience did teach me a lot about optimising my code so i could keep it playable for lower end devices, 
										and when unity 6 came out, i updated the game with its new optimisation features which further increased player frame rates.
