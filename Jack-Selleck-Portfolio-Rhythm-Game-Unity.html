									<h1>Coding C# in unity<br />
									</h1>
									<p>A solo project which I completed within four weeks<br />
									The code I am most proud of is for the audio analysis and delay<br />

								<h3>Features</h3>
								      <li>  An audio analysing script which creates a rhythm game level out of any audio of the players choice at runtime
								      <li>  An options menu allowing the player to customise note speed, note spawning sensitivity and minimum time between note spawns
									  <li>	A developed score system with Points, Combos, Gradings on note hits and an overall grade given at the end of the song based on the players points compared to the maximum points they could have achieved
									  </li>
									  <p></p>

										<h3>What I could have done differently<br /></h3>
										If I had chosen to analyse the songs before the rhythm game level starts rather than analyse whilst it plays, I could have known what the potential points were from the start, 
										allowing me to add a progress bar for the players overall ranking on the song.
										<br>If I did not have other projects to work on at the same time, I likely would have finished it faster
